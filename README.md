## Nobihaza VietNam BOT

A simple miscellaneous BOT made by Kennub but edited by Nozaki Yuu to make the BOT implementation easier!

## Instructions

To use this code, follow the instructions:

1) Install all dependencies:

    `npm i`

2) Create a .env file for environment variables in the root directory of this repository, not inside the `src` folder!

3) Create this environment variable:
    - **DISCORDJS_BOT_TOKEN** - Your Bot Token

4) Go to the `config.json` file and change the properties in that file according to your needs

5) Run `npm run start` or `npm run dev` in the project directory

## Notes

- Keep in mind all of the role IDs, channel IDs, etc. were all for my test server that I used for the tutorial. You must configure it yourself by changing the IDs to meet your needs.
